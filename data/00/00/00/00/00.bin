----[Release Notes]---------------------------------------:

Join renegade mechanic Robin and uncover the secrets of a 
dying planet. Explore a big world filled with intricate 
puzzles, interesting characters and menacing bosses in a 
beautiful platform adventure that tells a personal story 
about faith, purpose and the challenge of helping people.

Robin just wants to be a mechanic and help people, but 
without a license she’s a sinner in Mother’s eyes. Ever 
since picking up her wrench, the world has been going 
nuts and she's wanted to bolt it back together. Now 
Penance is raining down on everyone she loves and One 
Concern agents are after her.

But something big is going on – bigger than droughts of 
Ivory fuel and personal conflicts – and Robin’s in the 
thick of it.

- Hours of nut-twisting platform action-adventure

- Numerous densely detailed locations filled with fine-
tuned action and puzzles

- 20+ gear-grinding, screen-filling boss battles stand 
in your way

- Three game-changing difficulty settings supported by 
a unique tweak system

- A heart-wrenching epic – can one mechanic fix the 
whole world?

Iconoclasts is the masterwork of indie developer 
Joakim Sandberg, seven long years in the making. 
Iconoclasts delivers awesome action, hilarious hijinks 
and an emotional rollercoaster of deeply personal 
storytelling.
